# Crop-and-Soil-Data-Analysis-Prediction-Enhancing-Agricultural-Productivity-with-Machine-Learning-

Agriculture is the backbone of many economies, and leveraging data-driven insights can significantly improve crop yields and soil health. In my recent project, I explored a dataset containing various soil and crop parameters to uncover meaningful insights and predict the best fertilizer recommendations.

🔍 Project Highlights:
✅ Data Analysis & Visualization: Explored relationships between temperature, humidity, moisture, soil type, and crop type.
✅ Feature Engineering: Transformed categorical variables and optimized feature selection.
✅ Model Building: Implemented Random Forest Classifier & XGBoost to predict optimal fertilizers.
✅ Key Findings: Identified feature importance using permutation importance analysis.

📊 Results & Future Scope:
While the model achieved moderate accuracy, future improvements could involve hyperparameter tuning, incorporating more data sources, and exploring deep learning techniques.

📢 Why This Matters?
With precision agriculture becoming the norm, AI-powered predictions can help farmers make data-driven decisions, improving efficiency and sustainability.
